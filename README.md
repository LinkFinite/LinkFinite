Hello, I am LinkFinite. I joined becasue I thought it would be nice to have a github account, because I've used github for some time now. I am learning code and am at the basics.
If you can help me learn to code, please reach out to me at tmhubbartt@students.wcpss.net and help me learn to code!
By the way, if you have anything to recommend to me, Please send me it!
